# Been working on this `git` library

# Wanted to share what I learned

# It would be cool to have a workshop

# It would be cool if I made a `git` repository for the workshop

# It would be frustrating to manually cherry-pick and rebase

# Realised I had just spent the last couple of months writing a `git` library

# Wrote code to make my repository

# The code worked

# You can write code to make any history
