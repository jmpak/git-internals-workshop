You are in a maze of twisty little objects, all alike.

Exercise 1: run `cat .git/HEAD`

HEAD is a 'symbolic ref' that references the latest commit of the current
branch. It's a pointer to a pointer, which can get a little confusing.

Exercise 2: run `cat .git/refs/heads/master`

This is what HEAD currently points to. It stores an object reference as a SHA1
hash, which is what `git` uses to keep track of content.

Exercise 3: inspect `tools/resolve_ref.py`

This script resolves both symbolic and regular git refs and returns the SHA1
hash of an object.

Finally: run `git checkout step1`
