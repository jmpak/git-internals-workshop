Tag, you're it!

Exercise 1: run `ls .git/refs/tags`. Try `git cat-file -p <tag>` for each tag.

`git` has two types of tags: lightweight tags and annotated tags. Lightweight
tags resemble one of the files in `.git/ref/heads/` very closely: just a SHA1
hash referencing an object (blob/tree/commit/tag). Annotated tags are more like
a commit in that they have some fields (object, type, tag tagger) and an
annotation.

Exercise 2: Inspect the updated `tools/show_object.py` and run `python3
tools/show_object.py step4`

Like commits, tags are easy to pretty print.

Finally: run `git checkout step5` and `git show`
