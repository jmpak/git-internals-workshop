Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in
coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the
trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.

Exercise 1:

1. Run `git cat-file -p HEAD` and make a note of the first few characters of
   the SHA1 hash of the tree.
2. Run `git cat-file -p <first few characters>`

A tree is a git object that represents a directory. Tree entries can be either
trees (representing subdirectories) or blobs (representing files). `git`
stores only a very restricted set of file permissions, 100644 for blobs and
040000 for trees. Trees are the only place where file/directory names are
stored in `git`, and otherwise different files with the same content result in
the same object being stored under `.git/objects`. This is why git has its own
`git mv`.

Exercise 2: Inspect the updated `tools/show_object.py`

A SHA1 hash can be represented either as a 40-character hexadecimal sequence or
a 20-byte sequence. When storing tree objects, `git` uses the latter as this
takes up less space. This means additional logic is needed to pretty print
these objects. You can verify this by running `git cat-file tree <first few
characters>` which will print out the raw representation of the tree.

Finally: run `git checkout step3`
