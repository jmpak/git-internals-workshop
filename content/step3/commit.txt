Beware of the Blob! It creeps, and leaps, and glides and slides across the floor.

Exercise 1:

1. Find a blob object reference in `git cat-file -p <tree ref>`
2. `git cat-file -p <blob ref>`

A blob is what `git` calls a stored file.

Exercise 2: Inspect the updated `tools/show_object.py`

Pretty-printing blobs is relatively straightforward.

Finally: run `git checkout step4`
